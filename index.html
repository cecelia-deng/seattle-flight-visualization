          </div>
          <p>
            Seattle draws millions of visitors each year, but how do most people get there, and when is
            the best time to go? This interactive article explores travel patterns to the Emerald City, 
            beginning with a comparison of different transportation modes. We'll uncover why flights dominate 
            as the most popular way to reach Seattle, highlight the top airlines chosen by travelers, and 
            reveal the best times of year to plan your trip based on real travel data.

          <div class="title">How We Traveled Then vs. Now</div>
          In the 1800s, getting from New York City to Seattle meant a months-long journey by sea. 
          Travelers boarded ships down the Atlantic, around Cape Horn, and back up the Pacific before 
          finally reaching the Northwest. By the early 1900s, the completion of the transcontinental 
          railroads reshaped long-distance travel. What once required months at sea could now be done 
          in a week by train.

        </section>
        <section class="step" data-active-index="2">
          By the 2000s, air travel had become the primary way people reached Seattle. A trip that once demanded months at 
          sea or days on a train can now be completed in just a few hours. This change didn’t just make travel faster, it 
          transformed who could come to Seattle and how often. As flights became the dominant mode of transportation, 
          Seattle grew into one of the busiest air gateways in the Pacific Northwest.

        <section class="step" data-active-index="3">
          <div class="title">Why Flying to Seattle Is the Way to Go</div>
          And as air travel became the primary mode of transportation, Seattle grew into a major hub in the Pacific Northwest.  
          In the early years, most travelers leaving the city were locals heading to nearby West Coast destinations for business, 
          military travel, or family ties. But as Seattle’s tech sector exploded and its cultural influence spread, the city became 
          a magnet for newcomers. The flow of travelers changed direction: more and more people were flying into Seattle. New residents 
          searching for opportunity, tourists drawn to the region’s landscapes, and international visitors connecting through the city’s 
          increasingly global network.
        </section>
        <section class="step" data-active-index="3">
          Today, the most popular origins for flights into Seattle reflect this evolution. Many flights arrive from cities within the 
          Western U.S., echoing long-standing regional ties and shared economic corridors. Others come from major population centers 
          across the country, fueled by Seattle’s growing reputation as a tech powerhouse and gateway to the Pacific Rim.
          Together, these routes paint a picture of a city shaped by movement—both the people who leave and those who arrive.

          <div class="title">The Carriers Travelers Rely On Most</div>
          Today, travelers heading to Seattle have a wide range of reliable airline options. Alaska Airlines stands out as a 
          favorite for travelers heading to Seattle. With a strong presence across the West Coast and a major hub at 
          Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, it offers frequent flights, convenient connections, and flexible options—making it easy 
          for both local commuters and long-distance travelers to reach the Emerald City.
        </section>
        <section class="step" data-active-index="5">
          Followed by Delta, it offers a polished, nationally connected experience that appeals to travelers coming from major hubs across the country. 
          SkyWest and Horizon Air provide convenient regional connections, often serving smaller airports and making it easier for travelers outside 
          major cities to reach Seattle. United Airlines also plays an important role, giving travelers additional flexibility, especially for 
          those coming from the Midwest or East Coast. Together, these airlines make getting to Seattle more accessible than ever, 
          no matter where a journey begins.

          <div class="title">A Decade of Transformation</div>
          Seattle's aviation landscape underwent remarkable transformation over the past decade, driven by the Pacific 
          Northwest's booming tech economy and growing international connections. Major carriers recognized Seattle's 
          strategic importance as a gateway to Asia and invested heavily in expanding their presence. This interactive 
          chart reveals how different airlines pursued distinct growth strategies at Sea-Tac Airport. Click on any airline's 
          line to highlight it and see its specific growth trajectory. Hover over individual data points to explore the 
          year-by-year expansion that reshaped Seattle's skies.
        </section>
        <section class="step" data-active-index="7">
          Alaska Airlines, deeply rooted in the Pacific Northwest, led with an impressive 941% growth—rising from modest 
          beginnings to become the airport's dominant carrier. United Airlines achieved the most dramatic expansion at 1050%, 
          reflecting aggressive competitive positioning. Delta and Southwest also posted substantial gains of 720% and 1025% 
          respectively, each carving out their market niche. This decade of unprecedented growth transformed Seattle into 
          one of North America's major aviation hubs, setting the stage for the continued expansion we see today. The patterns 
          established during this period continue to influence how travelers reach the Emerald City.

          <div class="title">Timing Is Everything: When to Book Your Seattle Flight</div>
          Flight prices to Seattle fluctuate significantly throughout the year and even by the day of the week. 
          Understanding these patterns can save you hundreds of dollars on your trip. January emerges as the 
          cheapest month to fly, with prices dropping by as much as 30% below average after the holiday rush. 
          In contrast, summer months—especially June and July—see prices spike due to peak tourism demand and 
          favorable weather conditions.
        </section>
        <section class="step" data-active-index="9">
          <div class="title">The Week's Hidden Savings</div>
          The day of the week you choose to fly matters just as much as the month. Tuesday and Wednesday flights 
          are consistently 15-20% cheaper than weekend departures, as business travelers fill Monday and Friday 
          flights while leisure travelers crowd Sunday departures. Saturday flights offer a sweet spot for weekend 
          travelers looking to save. By being flexible with your departure day, you can significantly reduce your 
          airfare while enjoying the same Seattle experience.

          <div class="title">The Calendar of Flight Reliability</div>
          Based on a decade of Bureau of Transportation Statistics data and real-time 2024 patterns, each circle in 
          this calendar shows how likely you are to face delays when flying into Seattle. Green circles mark the 
          smoothest travel days with the lowest disruption. Yellow and orange represent moderate delays, 
          while red—especially clustered in December and around major holidays—signals a high chance of flight interruptions. 
          Larger circles indicate higher cancellation rates, and stars highlight holidays that tend to push delays even higher.

        </section>
        
        <section class="step" data-active-index="11">
          A closer look at the calendar reveals two troublemaker months: January and July. January is rough from start to 
          finish—big orange and red circles line up almost every day, thanks to winter storms, low visibility, and a busy 
          post-holiday rush that keeps delays piling up.

          July tells a different story. It’s not consistently bad, but the middle of the month turns fiery with orange 
          and red clusters. Summer thunderstorms across the country and Seattle’s peak travel season make 
          even small disruptions snowball fast.
